# DevPT — devpt.app

The master home page and hub for **DevPT**: a growing platform of simulation and
assessment tools for physical therapy education, built at the University of North
Dakota.

It's a single, self-contained static site (no build step). The app catalog is
data-driven: **[`apps.json`](apps.json) is the single source of truth**, and
`app.js` renders the "Practice tools" nav and the footer list from it.

## Stack

- `index.html` — markup & content, including the bespoke marketing "plates" for each app
- `apps.json` — **canonical app registry** (id, name, live URL, backing repo, status, placement)
- `styles.css` — light editorial theme, UND-green accent
- `app.js` — scroll reveal, in-view demo-video playback, and catalog rendering from `apps.json`
- `assets/` — logo, demo videos/posters, screenshots
- `CV - Dan Stone.pdf` — linked from the About section

Fonts (Hanken Grotesk + JetBrains Mono) load from Google Fonts; everything else is local.

## Run locally

Use the npm script, not a direct `python -m http.server`, so localhost cannot drift behind production unnoticed.

```bash
npm start          # syncs local main to origin/main, then serves http://localhost:8099
```

`npm start` runs `scripts/ensure-fresh-main.mjs` before serving. The guard fetches
`origin/main`; if local `main` is clean and behind, it fast-forwards automatically.
It refuses to serve if the checkout is dirty, ahead, diverged, detached, on another
branch, or unable to reach `origin/main`.

There is intentionally no stale-mode bypass. If localhost is serving this site, it
should represent the same source that deploys to `devpt.app`.

Serve over http(s), not `file://`, so `app.js` can `fetch('apps.json')`. If opened
as a local file, the page falls back to the static nav/footer lists in `index.html`.

## Add or retire an application

1. Edit **`apps.json`** — add or change one record:
   - `id` — stable slug; the plate element is `id="app-<id>"`
   - `name`, `tag` (mono nav label), `footerLabel`
   - `url` — the app's live URL
   - `repo` — the backing GitHub repo (`owner/name`)
   - `status` — `live` | `live-unlisted` | `internal`
   - `placement` — any of `hero`, `nav`, `plate`, `footer`
2. The **"Practice tools" nav** and the **footer list** re-render automatically from `apps.json`.
3. For a full marketing **plate**, also add an `<article class="plate" id="app-<id>">`
   block in `index.html` (copy an existing one). `app.js` logs a console warning if a
   plate's link doesn't match the `url` in `apps.json`.

Apps not yet surfaced on the hub (e.g. `scope-or-nope`, `wellness`,
`anatomy-database-app`, `MASH`) are tracked under `unlisted` in `apps.json` so the
portfolio stays self-describing.

## Checks

`scripts/check-apps.mjs` validates `apps.json` (required fields; allowed
`category` / `status` / `placement` values), confirms every `plate` app has a
matching `id="app-<id>"` and link in `index.html`, and pings each listed URL. It
runs in CI on every change to the catalog (`.github/workflows/check-apps.yml`)
and weekly to catch apps that go offline.

```bash
node scripts/check-apps.mjs            # full check (schema + page + ping)
node scripts/check-apps.mjs --no-ping  # skip network checks
```

## Deploy

**Azure Static Web Apps**, on push to `main`, via
`.github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps-black-tree-0e898330f.yml`
(`app_location: "/"`, `skip_app_build: true`). The `devpt.app` custom domain is
configured in the Azure Static Web Apps resource.
